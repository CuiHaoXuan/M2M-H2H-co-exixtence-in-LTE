Working Directory

Waf needs to run from its location at the top of the ns-3 tree. This becomes the working directory where output files will be written. But what if you want to keep those ouf to the ns-3 source tree? Use the --cwd argument:

$ ./waf --cwd=...

It may be more convenient to start with your working directory where you want the output files, in which case a little indirection can help:

$ function waff {
    CWD="$PWD"
    cd $NS3DIR >/dev/null
    ./waf --cwd="$CWD" $*
    cd - >/dev/null
  }

This embellishment of the previous version saves the current working directory, cdâ€˜s to the Waf directory, then instructs Waf to change the working directory back to the saved current working directory before running the program.
